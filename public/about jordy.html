<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! My name is Jordy, and I'm 29 years old. I was born and raised in a small town in the Netherlands called Strijen, located on the island of Hoeksche Waard.
</p>

<p>I am currently working as an implementation consultant, specializing in SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition, with a focus on Supply Chain and the Business Technology Platform. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Logistics Management and a minor in Logistics & IT, allowing me to blend my knowledge of business processes and IT solutions effectively.

  Before my current role, I worked as a Supply Chain Planner, where I gained extensive operational experience with SAP ECC. This role sparked my passion for ERP systems, particularly those from SAP. As a consultant, I now translate business requirements into IT solutions seamlessly, with a strong passion for process optimization.
</p>

<p>Outside of work, I am passionate about self-development and enjoy reading books that help me grow personally and professionally. I have a keen interest in web development and spend time learning about new technologies and coding practices.

  For relaxation and fitness, I love walking in the park, running, and climbing in bouldering halls. Watching football is another favorite pastime of mine, and I'm a dedicated Ajax fan. I also enjoy spending time in the sun and am excited about learning to ride a motorcycle in the near future.
